# Making a Tic-Tac-Toe (Ta-Te-Ti) Game
## Description
With your PLD group develop a simple tic-tac-toe game using all the tools you've learned so far.

## Requirements
- The game should randomly choose the player to start (X or O)
- On each turn, the player should enter the coordinates of the cell he wants to use. First the row, and then the column.
- The player can only insert numbers from 0 to 2. Any other char is not accepted and should ask for a new input.
- You can only use getchar() to read user input.
- The board must be displayed like this:

      * 0 1 2
      0 X| |O
      1  |X|O
      2 O| |

Where SPACE denotes an empty cell.

- If a player tries to use an ocuppied cell, the program should warn and ask for new coordinates.
- When the game ends, the program should print the player that won or TIE-MATCH and then EXIT.

That's all. Happy coding. :)
